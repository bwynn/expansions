I spend most of my professional time writing JavaScript and Golang web
applications as a UI Engineer at Apple, Inc. Some of that other time is spent in
meetings.

In my spare time, I like to spend time with my wife and son, and our dog Molly.
I dabble in the culinary sciences, primarily attempting to make different types
of breads and pretending that I can barbeque.

I grew up in the SF Bay Area, and graduated in 2006 from California Lutheran
University with an undergraduate degree in Multimedia Design.

In my past lives I have: managed bike shops for Mike's Bikes here in
the Bay Area. I also did a stint in marketing. I did not like it much.
