      <description>Background I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed my site in over 3 years.
Why the need for the change? At the time that I last worked on my site, it was to make sure that I had everything properly hosted while I was interviewing for my current job. I wrote bwynn.io in jQuery and my goals and objectives were different than my needs are now.
I saw a convergence of my various responsibilities in life open up for a chance to delve into Hugo.</description>

      <description>I spend most of my professional time writing JavaScript and Golang web applications as a UI Engineer at Apple, Inc. Some of that other time is spent in meetings.
I like to spend my spare time with my wife and son, and our dog Molly. I dabble in the culinary sciences, primarily attempting to make different types of breads and pretending that I can barbeque.
I grew up in the SF Bay Area making bike videos and getting chased around by rent-a-cops.</description>
