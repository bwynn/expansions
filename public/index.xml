      <description>I spend most of my professional time writing JavaScript and Golang web applications as a UI Engineer at Apple, Inc. Some of that other time is spent in meetings.
In my spare time, I like to spend time with my wife and son, and our dog Molly. I dabble in the culinary sciences, primarily attempting to make different types of breads and pretending that I can barbeque.
I grew up in the SF Bay Area, and graduated in 2006 from California Lutheran University with an undergraduate degree in Multimedia Design.</description>
