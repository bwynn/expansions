      <description>Background I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed my site in over 3 years.
Why the need for the change? At the time that I last worked on my site, it was to make sure that I had everything properly hosted while I was interviewing for my current job. I wrote bwynn.io in jQuery and my goals and objectives were different than my needs are now.
I saw a convergence of my various responsibilities in life open up for a chance to delve into Hugo.</description>
