      <h1>About</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I spend most of my professional time writing JavaScript and Golang web
applications as a UI Engineer at Apple, Inc. Some of that other time is spent in
meetings.</p>

<p>I like to spend my spare time with my wife and son, and our dog Molly.
I dabble in the culinary sciences, primarily attempting to make different types
of breads and pretending that I can barbeque.</p>

<p>I grew up in the SF Bay Area making bike videos and getting chased around by
rent-a-cops. My desire to go into film and love for the ocean and surfing took
me to Southern California, where I graduated in 2006 from California Lutheran
University with an undergraduate degree in Multimedia Design.</p>

<p>Turns out my desire to work in Hollywood was short-lived, and I took a job in
marketing right out of college.</p>

<p>I found myself back up in the Bay Area, managing a bike shop and riding bikes
again as we rounded into the 2010s. I met my wife while still running the store, and
I started getting teaching myself to code at night.</p>

<p>Persistence and a healthy dose of naïvety led me to leave my job  and venture
out into the digital world. It wasn&rsquo;t too long into my solo-gig that I was
recruited to work in QA at Apple. I haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>
